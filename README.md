# Building a conversational agent using Python, Flask and Javascript

This project was developed in Universidade de Aveiro, within the course of Sistemas Inteligentes II.

## 1st Deadline

1. Created an .json file with intents, that will help the chatbot to categorize the sentences. Only simple ones for now

2. Built a Neural Network for training the chatbot. It can be changed later as the number of intents grow.

3. Prepared data for the NN, using WordNet lemmatization and converting data in numerical values.

4. Using the NN model, the chatbot can now predict the class of one given sentence and choose one random answer from the available ones, of course inside that specific class.

## 2nd Deadline

1. Increase the number of intents, making the chatbot usable for a company.

2. Develop the ability to accumulate info from the client

3. Possible changes in neural network as the number of intents and sentences grow

4. Creating a Flask app to run our chatbot in a website

5. Creating a HTML/Javascript script to make the chatbot user-friendly
